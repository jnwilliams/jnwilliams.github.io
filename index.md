### About Me
Hello! I am a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon Univerity, 
advised by <a href="http:zicokolter.com" target="_blank"> Zico Kolter </a>.

My Research area focuses on machine learning and its social impact. Primarily, I am interested in understanding the long-term social ramifications of data-driven decision systems. I am currently funded through the Ford Foundation Pre-Doctoral Fellowship. 

Before CMU, I was a Post-Baccalaureatte Research Fellow with the Beckman Laser Institute at the University of California, Irvine, where I worked on automated analyses of in-vivo multi-photon microscopy images.
Even earlier, I was an undergraduate at Hampton University in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.
